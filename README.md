# alexa-spotify-connect (Connect Control for Spotify)

** FORKED FROM https://github.com/thorpelawrence/alexa-spotify-connect **
The purpose of this fork is to limit the devices controller to a single device, specified at the top of `connect.js`.
This means that the user doesn't have to list devices, specify a device etc - whenever a song is played, it is played to this device.
